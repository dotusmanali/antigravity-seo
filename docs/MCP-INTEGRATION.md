# MCP Integration

Antigravity SEO can use MCP-backed providers when they are configured in Antigravity. Missing MCP servers are reported as `setup_required`; workflows should not invent live SERP, map, crawl, or image-generation data.

## Supported Optional Providers

- **DataForSEO**: live SERP, keyword, backlinks, maps, AI visibility, merchant data
- **Firecrawl**: JS-rendered scraping, site maps, full-site crawling
- **Image generation**: SEO images and asset variants through the bundled image-gen workflow

## Config Location

Prefer Antigravity config paths:

- Project-local: `.gemini/config.toml`
- User-wide: `~/.gemini/config.toml`

Keep credentials out of version control. Provider-specific scripts use `~/.config/antigravity-seo/` for local credentials and read old `~/.config/antigravity-seo/` files only as migration fallback.

## Extension Helpers

```bash
./extensions/dataforseo/install.sh
./extensions/firecrawl/install.sh
./extensions/banana/install.sh
```

After installation, restart Antigravity so MCP server definitions are reloaded.
